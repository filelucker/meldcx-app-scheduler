## App scheduler

## Requirement: 
- The user can schedule any Android app which is installed on the device to start at a specific time.
- The user can cancel the schedule if the scheduled app has not started.
- The user can change the time schedule of an existing scheduled app.
- It should support multiple schedules without time conflicts.

  executed.

  Please build the app in Kotlin, follow the standard software development process, design
  your own UI/UX to achieve the above requirements. If any of the requirement you are not
